        <h3>About the Workshop</h3>
        <p>
            This workshop will bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners working on all aspects of Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) and error resilient compilation &mdash; from those studying sampling costs to those implementing protocols in real-world quantum computing pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to foster collaboration between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software developers building <b>open source QEM tooling</b> and integrations,</li>
            <li>Researchers exploring the <b>feasibility and limitations</b> of QEM,</li>
            <li>Practitioners <b>applying QEM</b> to improve near-term quantum hardware,</li>

Noise limits our ability to error-mitigate, a term that refers to near-term schemes where errors that arise in a quantum computation are dealt with in classical pre-processing. I present a unifying framework for error mitigation and an analysis that strongly limits the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively `undone' for larger system sizes, and shows that current error mitigation schemes are more or less as good as they can be. I will then switch gears and describe techniques to classically simulate expectation values on random circuits in the presence of non-unital noise.">

Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.">

Meanwhile, quantum error mitigation (QEM), which recovers expectation values from noisy circuits using additional runs, has emerged as an essential tool in many experiments due to its low hardware requirements. Given their complementary strengths, effectively integrating QEC and QEM is crucial for maximising the computational reach of the early-fault-tolerant hardware that we will soon have. Previous approaches of combining QEC and QEM have largely focused on applying QEM directly onto logical qubits. Here I will present our recent work that goes beyond the current paradigm, some of which rely on deceptively simple concepts but can be impactful in many practical scenarios.">

Dynamic circuits encapsulate both error correction codes and efficient circuits for entangled state preparation, gate teleportation, semi-classical Fourier transform, barren plateau free VQE, and more. The gate error is mitigated using the recently introduced Layered KIK protocol which extends the Adaptive KIK protocol to dynamic circuits. We will also present a mid-circuit measurement mitigation protocol based on the parity of consecutive measurements. This idea is also extended to terminating measurements and preparation error. As such, it offers an efficient alternative to gate set alternative. Finally, we present pseudo-twirling for mitigating coherent error in non-Clifford gates. Contrary to previous work on this topic, we provide a theoretical analysis that describes the nature of the residual incoherent error and the effect of the protocol on the native incoherent errors. Crucially, all the above-described methods are resilient to time drifts in the noise parameters and require no noise characterization. Supporting experimental results will be presented. This work paves the way to integration of error mitigation and error correction where error correction will do the heavy lifting of addressing local error, and error mitigation will mitigate errors that challenge error correction codes such as correlated errors and leakage errors.">

Additionally, I will introduce Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT), a method designed to reduce quantum resource requirements for state preparation and time evolution. By applying SeqHT, we achieve a ‚àº30% reduction in circuit depth, leading to significantly improved fidelities in our quantum simulations. SeqHT provides a general organizational framework applicable to simulations of systems with hierarchical energy or length scales. It also shines light on optimizing resource allocation in the context of quantum error correction.">

For quantum devices capable of partial quantum error correction, this inference may be limited, enabling only a limited reduction in logical noise rates. Quantum error mitigation is a natural way to use an increased number of circuit samples to make up for this limited correction. In this work we explore the potential of using circuit symmetry for reducing the sampling cost of mitigation at the physical qubit level.">

In this talk, I review one of the first efforts in studying measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions on superconducting quantum processors [1], discussing in particular the error reduction and mitigation strategies employed in the experiment. I summarize also an array of work probing condensed-matter systems in one, two, and higher dimensions [2-4] and non-Hermitian phenomena [5] on superconducting processors, focusing likewise on important error mitigation and suppression techniques. Collectively, these techniques span readout error mitigation, symmetry verification, zero noise extrapolation, and randomized compiling tailored for different contexts. Time permitting, I mention also a recently developed readout error mitigation method for mid-circuit measurements on dynamic circuits [6].

The method involves constructing a tensor network representation of the inverse of the global noise channel affecting the quantum processor's state, and subsequently applying this inverse map to informationally complete measurement data obtained from the noisy state. I will walk through the details of the algorithm and share recent results, including applications to 91-qubit circuits involving over 4,000 CNOT gates.">

Currently, the surface code is the leading quantum error-correcting code due to its high fault-tolerance thresholds and practical implementation requirements, which only necessitate nearest-neighbor interactions‚Äîa restriction suitable for many state-of-the-art platforms such as Google's and IBM's superconducting qubit systems. However, emerging quantum computing platforms, like reconfigurable neutral atom arrays, support arbitrary qubit connectivity. This flexibility prompts a fundamental question: can we outperform the surface code by exploiting non-local interactions? In this talk, we explore recent developments in high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that leverage non-local connectivity. We demonstrate that these codes can offer more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in resource efficiency compared to the surface code, significantly reducing spatial overhead required for quantum memory and logical gate operations. Additionally, we will discuss practical strategies for implementing the inherent non-local interactions of qLDPC codes within neutral atom platforms, highlighting both their potential advantages and technical challenges.

This talk outlines key challenges and considerations for extending QEM to distributed quantum computing (DQC), where circuit partitioning, inter-QPU communication, and synchronization introduce new sources of error and resource tradeoffs.
                                    We examine why QEM must adapt to these emerging execution models, focusing on overheads from communication-induced decoherence, redundant mitigation across device boundaries, and the complexity introduced by heterogeneous noise profiles. Common QEM techniques such as zero-noise extrapolation and probabilistic error cancellation are evaluated in the context of partitioned circuits, using synthetic circuit studies to characterize their scalability and limitations. The discussion also considers how compilation-time decisions affect mitigation feasibility and cost, and highlights the role of hybrid classical-quantum feedback and scheduling in real-world deployments.
                                    The aim of this talk is to raise awareness of the need for distribution-aware QEM frameworks and to foster collaboration across compiler, mitigation, and architecture communities.">
