Advances in quantum hardware and algorithms have made present-day devices increasingly useful in quantum simulation. In this talk, I review one of the first efforts in studying measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions on superconducting quantum processors [1], discussing in particular the error reduction and mitigation strategies employed in the experiment. I summarize also an array of work probing condensed-matter systems in one, two, and higher dimensions [2-4] and non-Hermitian phenomena [5] on superconducting processors, focusing likewise on important error mitigation and suppression techniques. Collectively, these techniques span readout error mitigation, symmetry verification, zero noise extrapolation, and randomized compiling tailored for different contexts. Time permitting, I mention also a recently developed readout error mitigation method for mid-circuit measurements on dynamic circuits [6].
