The Mitiq open source ecosystem is a community-driven toolkit for quantum error mitigation, developed by the Unitary Foundation to support resilient quantum computing across platforms. It implements techniques such as zero-noise extrapolation, probabilistic error cancellation, and virtual distillation, and integrates with major quantum software and hardware stacks. This talk highlights recent benchmarks, collaborative research, and design principles that make Mitiq a flexible and composable foundation for advancing both practical applications and fundamental studies of quantum error mitigation.
