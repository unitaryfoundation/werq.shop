Quantum hardware devices continue to expand in scale and are increasingly capable of suppressing, detecting, and correcting errors. The next challenge is to develop the crucial systems architecture to perform various computational tasks on emerging hardware more robustly and efficiently. My talk will introduce several recent results from our group at Yale about utilizing quantum error mitigation for logical error-corrected and error-detected qubits. I will discuss how error mitigation can be used to enhance fault tolerance schemes, from logical qubit encoding to logical error learning.
