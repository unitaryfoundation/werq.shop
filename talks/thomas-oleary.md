Redundancy through quantum circuit symmetry lies at the heart of quantum error correction, enabling precise inference of circuit errors. For quantum devices capable of partial quantum error correction, this inference may be limited, enabling only a limited reduction in logical noise rates. Quantum error mitigation is a natural way to use an increased number of circuit samples to make up for this limited correction. In this work we explore the potential of using circuit symmetry for reducing the sampling cost of mitigation at the physical qubit level.
