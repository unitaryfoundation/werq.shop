This talk presents the workflow for simulating the adiabatic state preparation of the ground state of a scalar field theory on IBM’s quantum computers. This includes error mitigation techniques that are particularly useful for time evolution such as self-mitigating circuits and operator decoherence renormalization. Additionally, I will introduce Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT), a method designed to reduce quantum resource requirements for state preparation and time evolution. By applying SeqHT, we achieve a ∼30% reduction in circuit depth, leading to significantly improved fidelities in our quantum simulations. SeqHT provides a general organizational framework applicable to simulations of systems with hierarchical energy or length scales. It also shines light on optimizing resource allocation in the context of quantum error correction.
