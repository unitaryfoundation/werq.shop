I will present our workflow for simulating the adiabatic state preparation of the ground state of a scalar field theory on IBM’s quantum computers. This includes error mitigation techniques that are particularly useful for time evolution such as self-mitigating circuits and operator decoherence renormalization. I will also discuss quantum simulation strategies and limitations for systems using 100 qubits. (Our definition of “quantum simulation” refers to simulating quantum systems on quantum devices, as opposed to simulating quantum device behaviors on classical computers.) Additionally, I will introduce Sequency Hierarchy Truncation (SeqHT), a method designed to reduce quantum resource requirements for state preparation and time evolution. By applying SeqHT, we achieve a ∼30% reduction in circuit depth, leading to significantly improved fidelities in our quantum simulations. SeqHT provides a general organizational framework applicable to simulations of systems with hierarchical energy or length scales. It also shines light on optimizing resource allocation in the context of quantum error correction.
