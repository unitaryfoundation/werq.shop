Despite rapid advances in quantum hardware, achieving full fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction (QEC) remains a significant challenge. Meanwhile, quantum error mitigation (QEM), which recovers expectation values from noisy circuits using additional runs, has emerged as an essential tool in many experiments due to its low hardware requirements. Given their complementary strengths, effectively integrating QEC and QEM is crucial for maximising the computational reach of the early-fault-tolerant hardware that we will soon have. Previous approaches of combining QEC and QEM have largely focused on applying QEM directly onto logical qubits. Here I will present our recent work that goes beyond the current paradigm, some of which rely on deceptively simple concepts but can be impactful in many practical scenarios.
