      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>What can we compute in the presence of noise? Noise limits our ability to error-mitigate, a term that refers to near-term schemes where errors that arise in a quantum computation are dealt with in classical pre-processing. I present a unifying framework for error mitigation and an analysis that strongly limits the degree to which quantum noise can be effectively `undone' for larger system sizes, and shows that current error mitigation schemes are more or less as good as they can be. I will then switch gears and describe techniques to classically simulate expectation values on random circuits in the presence of non-unital noise.</p>
