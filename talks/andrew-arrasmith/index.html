      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>We propose to hold an open discussion of the challenges of balancing the general utility of open source error mitigation tools with the need for hardware specific details to achieve the best results. We intend to bring up questions about what information needs to (and can) be exposed by hardware providers as well as how open source toolsets can be enabled to utilize that information.</p>
