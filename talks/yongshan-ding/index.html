        <p class="speaker-bio">I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and of Applied Physics at Yale University. I am a member of the Yale Quantum Institute (YQI) and affiliated with the Computer Systems Lab (CSL). I lead the Quantum Systems Lab (QSL) at Yale and direct Yale&#39;s Quantum Science and Engineering Certificate program. Our research focuses on advancing the capability and performance of next-generation quantum information systems. We work on a broad set of problems related to algorithms and architectures of quantum computers.</p>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Quantum hardware devices continue to expand in scale and are increasingly capable of suppressing, detecting, and correcting errors. The next challenge is to develop the crucial systems architecture to perform various computational tasks on emerging hardware more robustly and efficiently. My talk will introduce several recent results from our group at Yale about utilizing quantum error mitigation for logical error-corrected and error-detected qubits. I will discuss how error mitigation can be used to enhance fault tolerance schemes, from logical qubit encoding to logical error learning.</p>
