          <p class="bio-condensed"> I&#39;m a PhD student at the University of Oxford taking part in the Computational Discovery DTC. I&#39;m funded (by EPSRC &amp; IBM) to do research into near term quantum algorithms. Particular areas of focus are quantum simulation and controlling quantum errors. I worked at Los Alamos National Lab during Summer 22 as part of their Quantum Computing Summer School. I have an MSci in Physics and Computer Science from Durham University where my thesis (which can be read on the &#39;projects page&#39;) was supervised by Viv Kendon and Nick Chancellor. In between graduating and starting the PhD I worked as a software engineer at Elsevier in London.</p>

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>Redundancy through quantum circuit symmetry lies at the heart of quantum error correction, enabling precise inference of circuit errors. For quantum devices capable of partial quantum error correction, this inference may be limited, enabling only a limited reduction in logical noise rates. Quantum error mitigation is a natural way to use an increased number of circuit samples to make up for this limited correction. In this work we explore the potential of using circuit symmetry for reducing the sampling cost of mitigation at the physical qubit level.</p>
