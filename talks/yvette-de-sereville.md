We introduce an approach to error mitigation tailored to specific applications using targeted characterization measurements. Beyond matching the general error mitigation strategy to the application, we will discuss methods for tuning the parameters of the chosen error mitigation technique. We also show how running characterization circuits allows us to choose which of the set of possible error detection flags will result in the largest improvement in overall circuit fidelity.
